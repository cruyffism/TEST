        WHAT HAPPENED? Speculation surrounding Messi's potential transfer back to his beloved Barcelona is rife. 
    However, he got a welcome break from the European transfer rumour mill
    at the 2022 International Football History and Statistics Federation (IFFHS) Awards, 
    where he picked up three trophies: IFFHS World's Best Player,<br />
    IFFHS World's Best Playmaker, and IFFHS World's Best International Goal Scorer. 
    Not a bad return! Posting a picture of his haul on Instagram, 
    Messi wrote: "It was an honor to receive from the International Football History and Statistics Federation 
    (IFFHS) these three awards for 2022... Thank you!"
