      WHAT HAPPENED? Speculation surrounding Messi's potential transfer back to his beloved Barcelona is rife.
      However, he got a welcome break from the European transfer rumour mill
      at the 2022 International Football History and Statistics Federation (IFFHS) Awards,
      where he picked up three trophies: IFFHS World's Best Player,<br />
      IFFHS World's Best Playmaker, and IFFHS World's Best International Goal Scorer.
      Not a bad return! Posting a picture of his haul on Instagram,
      Messi wrote: "It was an honor to receive from the International Football History and Statistics Federation
      (IFFHS) these three awards for 2022... Thank you!"
